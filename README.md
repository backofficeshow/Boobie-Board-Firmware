# Boobie-Board-Firmware
The standard operating firmware for the Boobie Board (Basix)

Not particularly cleverly written and designed for the CCS PCWHD Compiler. I did port it to Microchip's own compiler once and added a lot of advanced features, one day I will find it again, but in the mean time, feel free to tinker with this one.

I have included the .hex for version 1.3 Boobie Basix
